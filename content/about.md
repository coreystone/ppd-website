## Data points
#### :blue_book: Privacy Policy
A hyperlink to a company's privacy policy (sometimes called a privacy "notice" or "statement").


#### :email: Contact
An email address to contact that can initiate or fulfill a privacy request; usually a company's privacy department, [data protection officer ("DPO")](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-protection-officer-dpo.asp), or support team.


#### :memo: Request Form
A hyperlink to a form, mechanism, or instructions to submit a request; these can be internal to a company or be provided by a third-party solution (a common example is a [OneTrust webform](https://www.onetrust.com/products/privacy-rights-automation/))


#### :card_index: Request Type
Categorizes the method a company provides to its users to submit a request.

[Per the CCPA](https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#collapse2c), *"businesses must designate **at least two methods** for you to submit your request"*, but some privacy policies may be *outdated*, *incomplete*, or *obfuscated* to make submitting requests more difficult. Smaller, sketchy companies will sometimes do this.
* :gear: `Account settings` -- a mechanism to make a request is found within the service after logging into an account.
* :email: `Email` -- a request must be submitted directly via email to a specified address
* :outbox_tray: `External form` -- a request must be created through a third-party web form
	* ([OneTrust](https://www.onetrust.com/), [Truyo](https://truyo.com/), [Securiti](https://securiti.ai/), [TrustArc](https://trustarc.com/), [Wirewheel.io](https://wirewheel.io/) are the most popular solutions)
* :inbox_tray: `Internal form` -- the company provides its own form or mechanism for users to submit requests
* :phone: `Phone` -- the company provides a phone number to handle data requests


#### :balance_scale: Privacy frameworks
Indicates whether a privacy policy explicitly mentions a respective states's privacy law or that residents of respective state have special rights.
* [`California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)`](https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)
* [`Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)`](https://coag.gov/resources/colorado-privacy-act/)
* [`Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)`](https://portal.ct.gov/AG/Sections/Privacy/The-Connecticut-Data-Privacy-Act)
* [`Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)`](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/)
* [`Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)`](https://wirewheel.io/blog/utah-consumer-privacy-act/)


#### :bar_chart: CCPA Metrics
A link to the company's [CCPA metrics report](https://www.onetrust.com/blog/ccpa-metric-reporting-requirement/) if applicable.
* Per  [Section 999.317(g) of the CCPA](https://cpra.gtlaw.com/999-317-training-record-keeping/): *"a business that knows or reasonably should know that it, alone or in combination, buys, receives for the businessâ€™s commercial purposes, sells, or shares for commercial purposes the personal information of 10,000,000 or more consumers in a calendar year shall"* compile metrics on its requests received.


## The project
This project was heavily inspired by and modeled after [2fa.directory](https://2fa.directory/). 

Users deserve the right to be able to quickly and easily exercise their data rights without being slowed down by intentionally confusing or incomplete privacy policies. That's why PPD gives you everything you need to know about exercising your data rights with the companies on this list, such as an email to contact, a web-form to fill out, or a link to instructions to complete your request.

Privacy Policy Directory is an [**`open-source project`**](https://github.com/coreystone/privacy-policy-directory-data) derived from *publicly available* information (such as company privacy policies, support articles, and other resources online). 

*(Disclaimer)* There is **no guarantee** that all of the information provided is correct: policies, links, and processes constantly change and entries in this directory can become stale at any time. This information is presented **as-is** and is only intended to serve as a point of reference.

Are you also passionate about privacy and want to spare your time? Any and all help is welcomed, including programming, design, and data entry. There are always more companies to document, features to add, and bugs to squash.
